### UIHint

**[UIHint(AIHint.Input)]** => for one line input fields (string)

**[UIHint(AIHint.Textarea)]** => for multi line input fields (string)

**[UIHint(AIHint.Image)]** => for image fields (ContentReference or Url)

### [AIUseToAnalyzeContent]

You can utilize prompts with the placeholder ::this::. This means it can comprehend and integrate with the context of the page, block, product, or any other object the user is currently engaging with.

To ensure this functions correctly, you should annotate the model's property with [AIUseToAnalyzeContent]. However, it's important not to apply it to every propertyâ€”only those that are relevant to the context of the object.

### [AIAssistant]

#### For text fields
**[AIAssistant(Model = "gpt-3.5-turbo-16k")]** => The model to use => https://platform.openai.com/docs/models

**[AIAssistant(AssistantInstructions = "You are a selling professional sales assistant")]** => It's designed to set the behavior of the assistant. You might use the message to specify a role or provide some context for the assistant.

**[AIAssistant(ShortcutsDisabled = false)]** => Disable and hide Shortcuts on this property

#### For XHtmlString fields (Rich text editor)

**[AIAssistant(QueryParameters = "")]** => Additional querystring appended to imageurl into XHtmlString (TinyMCE) eg width=100&height=300&format=webp&quality=75

**[AIAssistant(ImageWidth = "")]** => Default Imagewidth added to attribute width on img-tag into XHtmlString (TinyMCE)

#### For Image fields (ContentReference or Url)

**[AIAssistant(ImageGenerationSize = "")]** => ImageSize to generate Image in, Small is 256x256, Medium is 512x512, Large is 1024x1024


## TinyMCE (XHtmlString-properties)

Add "ai_assistant_execute ai_assistant_image" to Toolbar in TinyMceConfiguration

## Image Generation

Add [UIHint(AIHint.Image)] for image fields (ContentReference or Url)

Add "ai_assistant_image" to Toolbar in TinyMceConfiguration

Files are automatically saved in "For this page" - except for Commerce products or other object that do not have "For this page", then it saved to the Global Root Asset folder. This default behavior can be modified either by implementing the IFolderResolver interface or by overriding the DefaultFolderResolver.

### OpenAI Api key

You need your own API key for the Image Generation to work, you can obtain a key by registering and create an key here => https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys 

add the key to your appsettings: 
'  "Epicweb": {
    "AIAssistant": {
      "ApiKey": "sk-NpPD....jrwm"
      }
    }'
