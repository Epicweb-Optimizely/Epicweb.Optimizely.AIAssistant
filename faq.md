Additionally, you can command the AI Assistant by initiating the text with the symbol "#"

Examples: 

- #summarize "a long text"
- #summarize ::Main body::  (this will refer to the property "Main body", if you have such)
- #summarize in a selling way ::this::  (this will refer to all content on the page/block/product)
- #check spelling "a long text with misspelling"
- #generate a really short text about cats
