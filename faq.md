# FAQ

**The FAQ is currently undergoing continuous updates**

## How does it work? 
In short, the AI Assistant offers automated **suggestions** and alternative wording for your writing, while also providing **translation** capabilities for texts and properties on pages and blocks.

Additionally, you can command the AI Assistant by initiating the text with the symbol "#"

Examples: 

- #summarize "a long text"
- #summarize ::Main body::  (this will refer to the property "Main body", if you have such)
- #summarize in a selling way ::this::  (this will refer to all content on the page/block/product)
- #check spelling "a long text with misspelling"
- #generate a really short text about cats
- #Can you provide me with examples of article titles related to paint brushes?

It's really powerful and intuitive
