# Image Generation with DALL-E and Recraft AI within Optimzely CMS and Commerce

In this demonstration of the AI-Assistant, we utilize the Image Property feature. We prompt for an image, then generate four variations. From these, we select a favorite and produce four additional variations. We also highlight the 'show all history' button, which displays all the versions generated during this session. Ultimately, we select a final image. 

Images can also be downloaded and saved under 'For this page' or directly under choosen asset folder. 

We support Dall-e 3 and Recraft AI out of the box.
