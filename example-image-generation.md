# Image Generation with DALL-E within Optimzely CMS and Commerce

In this demonstration of the AI-Assistant, we utilize the Image Property feature. We prompt for an image, then generate four variations. From these, we select a favorite and produce four additional variations. We also highlight the 'show all history' button, which displays all the versions generated during this session. Ultimately, we select a final image. Only the selected file is automatically saved under 'For this page'. 

We support Dall-e 2 and 3.
