### Suggestions

1. Generating Text Suggestions: After typing your text, click on the blue AI logo button. By default, the AI will offer an improved version of your text, ensuring correct spelling and enhanced clarity.

2. Implementing the Suggested Text: To accept and replace your original text with the AI's suggestion, click on "Use this suggestion".

### Using Prompts

1. Commanding the AI: Start your instruction with a # symbol followed by the specific command you wish to give.

2. Processing the Command: Click the blue AI logo button to initiate the AI's response. Think of it as "spinning the wheel" to see what the AI produces based on your prompt.

### Translating Text

1. Automated Translation: If you have a text segment that needs translation and an equivalent exists in another language within the same field, simply press the blue AI logo button. The system will prioritize translating from the master language. If the master language version isn't available, it will use another available language to translate the text into the desired context language.

2. Contextual Translation: If you're on a Spanish context page/block/product, you can paste English text into the property field. Click the blue AI logo button to initiate translation. The AI will then suggest a Spanish version of the content.

3. Prompt Translation: Alternatively, you can use a prompt to specify the desired translation. For example, input #Translate to Spanish: "<your English text here>" and then click the blue AI logo button to get the translated content.

### Using the AI Enhancement

1. Getting Suggestions: Ensure you highlight or select the specific text you wish to modify. Once selected, click the 'AI' button. The default action will replace your text with a suggested, correctly spelled version.

2. Comparing Changes: To view the differences between the original text and the AI-modified version, use the Ctrl+z shortcut to undo the change and view the original, and Ctrl+y to redo and view the AI's suggestion.

### Using Prompts

1. Commanding the AI: When giving commands to the AI, always begin with a # followed by your specific instruction. Ensure you select both the hashtag and any accompanying text, table, or list you want the AI to process.

2. Processing the Command: Once your instruction and content are selected, click the 'AI' button.

3. Reviewing Changes: As before, if you wish to compare the before and after versions, toggle between them using the Ctrl+z and Ctrl+y shortcuts.

### Translating Text

1. Automated Translation: If you have a text segment that needs translation and an equivalent exists in another language within the same field, simply press the 'AI' button. The system will prioritize translating from the master language. If the master language version isn't available, it will use another available language to translate the text into the desired context language.
